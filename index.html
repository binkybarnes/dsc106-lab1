      Ever launching Caseoh in a rocket is a purely impossible feat. The current
      worlds most powerful rocket the Starship prototype is only capable or
      producing 17 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. The rocket already takes
      8 seconds to lift off just under propellent load. The max gross weight of
      the starship is 250 tonnes of expendable cargo. This means Caseoh would
      not even be able to come back. This simply is not enough force for Caseoh
      to escape gravity. If we were able to use an RocketdyneF-1A liquid fueled
      engine, the most powerful single nozzle engine ever made, instead of a
      SpaceX raptor engine this would increase our thrust. Producing a trust at
      1,800,000 lbf (8 MN). We would still need an insane amount of these
      engines to even have a shot of attempting this feat. The accoutics and
      fuel load of this rocket would be an insane logistics problem, if pulled
      off a true feat of engineering. The F-1A engine also never flown, so this
      purely hypothetical. While a heavily modified F-1B is being produced for
      the SLS we still don't know the true thrust of the engine. However this
      isnt the true most powerful engine. Our final contestant is the double
      SRBs on present on SLS. Producing a whopping 3.3 million pounds of thrust,
      these are a worthy contender. However it would be almost impossible to use
      more than two, which we would certainly need. They also only burn for 122
      seconds. Caseoh will accelerate incredibly slow due to his weight and this
      would not produce enough burn time.
